# Maven-Family-Leave-Challenge-

## Business Case

International labour Organization Convention No. 183 States that  companies provide for at least 14 weeks of leave at a rate of at least twothirds of previous earnings, paid by social insurance or public funds or in a manner determined by national law and practice where the employer is not solely responsible for payment.

The Maven family leave challenge is to find if most companies in different Industries measure up to the ILO 14 weeks leave recommendation.

I worked on a dataset from 1,601 companies across different industries, including paid/unpaid maternity and paternity leave weeks.

## Analysis Question:
* Which companies offer the most paid parental leave weeks?
* Is maternity leave typically longer than paternity leave?
* What is the distribution of parental leave weeks offered?
* Are there noticable differences between industries?

## In this analysis, I provided insights on:
* The Top Industries that Offer paid Leave 
* Top Industies that offer unpaid leave 
* Top three companies that offer paid leave 

## Findings 

* The top comapanies with the most companies are Grant Thornton as it offer 51 weeks paid leave for both new mothers and fathers, follows by LAC Group, which offer 35 weeks paid leave to new fathers and 33 weeks paid leave to new mothers.Lastly Flatiron Health, Offers 30 weeks paid leave for both new mothers and fathers.
* Finance Industry tops the chart for the industry the offer the most paid leave, The average paid leave is 16 weeks long , follows by technology Industry, which offers 15 weeks paid leave on an average.
* Top Industies that offer unpaid leave are printing Industy , Pharmacies and drug stores. Printing Industry offers 40 weeks unpaid leave for both new mothers and fathers on an average while Pharmacies and drugstore offers 14 weeks unpaid leave on an average. 

* 1548 out of 1600 companies offer paid maternity, makes up to 55.11% of the total companies, out of the 1548 paid leaves, 75.79% are below the ILO recommendation of 14 weeks paid parental leave. 33.36% leave offers are unpaid.
* Industries that offer the most paid materinity leave are philantrophy Industry an average of 22.4 weeks leave , conglomerate and average of 15.1% weeks leave .

* 257 out of 1600 companies offer paid paternity leave, accounting for the 9.15% of the total number of companies, and out of the 257 leaves 11.44% are below  ILO  14 weeks leave recommendation.

* The average maternity  leave is appromximately 11 weeks, while paternity leave is 7 weeks.
* New fathers are hardly offered paid paternity leave, 1291 less than paid maternity leave.

## How lack or less paternity leaves affect businesses and working fathers 

* Negative impact on employee morale and productivity: Fathers who are not given time off to bond with their newborns may experience stress and reduced productivity, which can impact the overall morale and productivity of the workplace.

* Difficulty in recruiting and retaining employees: Companies that do not offer paternity leave may struggle to attract and retain top talent, particularly if their competitors offer better benefits packages.

* Perception of unfairness and inequality: The lack of paternity leave can be perceived as unfair and can contribute to gender inequality in the workplace. This may be particularly true if the company offers maternity leave, but not paternity leave.

* Impact on family dynamics: Fathers who are unable to take time off to bond with their newborns may miss out on important family moments and may feel less connected to their children and partners.

* Potential legal risks: In some countries, failure to offer paternity leave may be a violation of labor laws, which can result in legal action against the company.

Overall, not offering paternity leave can have a negative impact on employee morale, recruitment and retention, gender equality, family dynamics, and may even pose legal risks for the company.
