# Maven-Family-Leave-Challenge-

## Business Case

International labour Organization Convention No. 183 States that  companies provide for at least 14 weeks of leave at a rate of at least twothirds of previous earnings, paid by social insurance or public funds or in a manner determined by national law and practice where the employer is not solely responsible for payment.

The Maven family leave challenge is to find if most companies in different Industries measure up to the ILO 14 weeks leave recommendation.

I worked on a dataset from 1,601 companies across different industries, including paid/unpaid maternity and paternity leave weeks.

## Analysis Question:
* Which companies offer the most paid parental leave weeks?
* Is maternity leave typically longer than paternity leave?
* What is the distribution of parental leave weeks offered?
* Are there noticable differences between industries?

## In this analysis, I provided insights on:
* The Top Industries that Offer paid Leave 
* Top Industies that offer unpaid leave 
* Top three companies that offer paid leave 
*
